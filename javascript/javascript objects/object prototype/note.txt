Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain
how prototype chains work and look at how the prototype property can be used to add methods to existing constructors

Note: We want to reiterate that the methods and properties are not copied from one object to another in the prototype
chain. They are accessed by walking up the chain as described above.
