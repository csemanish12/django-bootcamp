    <!-- we use a more modern JavaScript feature to solve the problem, the defer attribute, which tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content once the <script> tag element has been reached -->
    <script src="static/js/index.js" defer></script>
    <!--defer only works for external  -->
    <!-- other alternative for solving blocking script
    <script async src="static/js/index.js" ></script>

    Scripts loaded using the async attribute (see below) will
    download the script without blocking rendering the page and
    will execute it as soon as the script finishes downloading.
    You get no guarantee that scripts will run in any specific
    order, only that they will not stop the rest of the page
    from displaying. It is best to use async when the scripts
    in the page run independently from each other and depend
    on no other script on the page.

    async should be used when you have a bunch of background
    scripts to load in, and you just want to get them in place
    asap. For example, maybe you have some game data files to
    load, which will be needed when the game actually begins,
    but for now you just want to get on with showing the game
    intro, titles, and lobby, without them being blocked by
    script loading.

    All the scripts with the defer attribute will load in the
    order they appear on the page. So in the second example,
    we can be sure that jquery.js will load before script2.js
    and script3.js and that script2.js will load before
    script3.js. They won't run until the page content has all
    loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM
    being in place (e.g. they modify one of more elements on
    the page)

Scripts loaded using the defer attribute (see below) will run in the order they appear in the page and execute them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:
